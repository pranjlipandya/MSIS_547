### Project Idea: EcoTrack - A Smart Recycling Assistant

**Brief Overview:**
EcoTrack is a mobile application designed to revolutionize the way individuals and households manage their recycling efforts. Utilizing AI technology, EcoTrack simplifies the recycling process by providing users with instant information on how to recycle various items correctly. By scanning the barcode or taking a picture of an item, users can receive detailed instructions on recycling procedures, including sorting tips and the nearest recycling facilities that accept those items. The app also tracks users' recycling habits, offering insights and rewards to encourage and gamify the recycling process.

**Key Features:**

* **Smart Scan** : Instantly identify recyclable items using the camera or barcode scanner.
* **Recycling Guide** : Access a comprehensive database with recycling instructions for a wide range of materials.
* **Habit Tracking** : Monitor your recycling habits with statistics and progress reports.
* **Rewards System** : Earn points for consistent recycling, redeemable for discounts or donations to environmental causes.
* **Community Challenges** : Participate in community-wide recycling challenges to compete and collaborate with others for a greener planet.

**Objective:**
The primary goal of EcoTrack is to make recycling accessible, understandable, and engaging for everyone, thereby increasing recycling rates and contributing to environmental sustainability.

**Enhancements Made:**

* Add a logo to the top left.
* Transform the "Learn More" button to be more interactive. Apart from changing color on hover, we can add a slight 3D effect on click, making the user experience more dynamic.
